    STEP 5 Completed at 20h24 ( in appx 1h20)

    Notes:
        *The UX part of the course is very important, I should consider going back to it, each time I want to design a website until I get familiar with EACH and EVERY concept. 
        *Decided to breakdown the STEPS and to pass every step with each part of the Course completed.
        *The five seconds test is a good idea to test if the website is understandable and attractive to people.
        *The Step 4 and 5 are very important and new to me, I should get back to them as often I can when I'm looking forward to a project.

    What I'm learning:
        *UX is very important and determines wheither people will tend to want to stay or leave your website. 
        *When designing the website, it's important to put yourself in the clients' place, and try to imagine what will make him stay and what will make leave.
        *Make it so every person understand where they are and how to navigate, wherever they are. 
        *It's important to take into account the people who don't have the same motor reflexes AND patience as us. Time lags on certain "hover" effects are important to put into the code to make it easier for people to navigate through the website
